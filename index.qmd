## About me
Hi! ü§ñ I am a graduate student researcher at IIIT Hyderabad, supervised by Prof. [Zia Abbas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8oYH-fUAAAAJ) and Prof. [Amir Ahmad](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qD63RCUAAAAJ). My research interests primarily lie in **trustworthy deep learning** practices focussed on **personalized healthcare** and **aiding scientific discoveries**. I hope to someday discover **advanced network architectures** üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è that draw inspiration from natural processes and help AI reason the way we as humans do. Welcome to my personal website where I post content about my interests and my work!

## Latest Research
- I am currently exploring advanced ensembling techniques to tackle imbalanced data in healthcare and studying the effects of ensemble diversity on its performance. (In Review)
- In my previous project, I came up with a cascaded meta-learning architecture to significantly improve statistical leakage estimation in Digital VLSI Circuits. ([Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10558185) | [Presentation](https://youtu.be/Qnr6r3iCyI0))

## Updates!
- I am in my **final year of my graduate studies** and am on the look out for interesting _research opportunities!_ Please reach out to me if I seem like a good fit.

Critical applications such as healthcare often deal with highly imbalanced datasets where the minority class is usually of significant importance.

With the introduction of SMOTE and subsequent variants, oversampling algorithms became one of the most widely adopted solutions for imbalanced datasets. This work reviews a subset of SMOTE variants and the performance improvements they provide on commonly used imbalanced datasets.

The quality analysis of such a popular and widely consumed crop is of paramount importance as many people are dependent on rice to meet their nutrition requirements.

We use the smartphone as a sensor to capture images and then perform analysis on the image. Our proposed method allows people with limited access to technology such as farmers to perform accurate analysis of rice grains by making use of available gadgets such as smartphones. The method can also be easily extended for other edible food grains too.\nPublisher: NA | Journal (Draft) | 2022"
